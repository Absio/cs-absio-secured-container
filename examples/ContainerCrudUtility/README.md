# Container CRUD Utility

This application is a CLI application that is intended to show the developer how to use the API for container operations.

## Building

There are no changes needed in order to build this sample application.  All required dependencies are publicly available on nuget.

## Running

This sample application is a CLI.  Therefore, it can be run in the IDE or by running the exe directly.  Either way it has two required parameters in before it can be started: the API Server's URL and the API Key.  Below is the format of the parameters.<p>
*--url <the API Server url> --apikey <your API Key>*<p>
If you do not have access to an API Server you can use Absio's [Sandbox API Server ](https://sandbox.absio.com).  If you do not have an API Key, find out how [here](https://github.com/Absio/cs-absio-secured-container#obtaining-an-api-key).

### Usage
